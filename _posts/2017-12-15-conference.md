## Gene-Regulatory Systems in Development 27th-29th March 2017, Carmona, Spain

Our jointly organised conference with fellow ITN project [DevCom](https://www.devcom-itn.eu/) proved a great success. Set in the beautiful town of Carmona, just outside Seville in Spain. It created a beautiful backdrop for an interesting and fruitful conference that all our students were able to attend and take part in the poster session. Invaluable time was spent networking with promient invited speakers and a session with the editor of Nat Genet was another highlight for our group.
