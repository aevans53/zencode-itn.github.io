### Background
- I am a PhD candidate in the Computational Regulatory Genomics group at Imperial College London, UK. Before starting my studies here, I carried out both my undergraduate and M.Sc. degrees in Molecular Biology at The Faculty of Science, Croatia. For a long time I have been interested in computational biology, and it was this interest which initially led me to take part in a project aimed at characterising the mechanisms of formation and evolution of chimeric transcripts. Following on from this, I became interested in the interplay of different OMICs technologies; due to their ability to assemble a range of information formats into a single picture, overall affording us a better understanding of disease. This underlying concept formed the foundation of my my Masterâ€™s thesis - where I used genomic, epigenomic and glycomic data from 4000 patients in an attempt to identify potential biomarkers of lower-back pain.

- Being able to meet likeminded people, pursue my interests, learn a lot and apply gained knowledge, I am looking forward to the three-year research training within the ZENCODE-ITN.
